# Flask Remote File Manager

A self-hosted, Flask-based web file manager designed for local network (LAN) file management and batch script execution. This tool allows you to manage server files and trigger custom scripts directly from a mobile or desktop browser without using SSH.

## Key Features
* **Batch Script Execution:** Select multiple files and run custom scripts against them. This is ideal for processing tasks, like transcoding.
* **Mobile Friendly:** Designed specifically for LAN access so you can manage your home lab or media server from your phone.
* **Real-time Logging:** A dedicated log panel displays script output, process status, and file deletion confirmations.
* **Selection Tools:** Includes "Select All," "Clear Selection," and "View Selected" to handle large directories efficiently.
